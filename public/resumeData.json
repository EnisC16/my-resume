I got my first job as a developer 6 years ago as a student and realized that I learn much more in my job then I did in university. So I made a choice... I started a full-time job as a software developer and did my bachelor degree at the same time. It was quiet tough, because I needed to travel a lot for the job but I loved it. I love to learn as much as possible. And I like to be challanged.",
